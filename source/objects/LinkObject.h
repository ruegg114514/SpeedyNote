/**
 * @brief An annotation: 3 configurable link slots plus an optional highlight.

 * "Annotation" is the user-facing word for this class. A LinkObject whose
 * @ref region is empty is a standalone link icon; one whose region is non-empty
 * is a highlight. Same class, same lifetime, same controls -- "standalone" is
 * not a special case.
 *
 * LinkObject is created:
 * - Automatically when highlighting PDF or OCR text (description = extracted
 *   text, region = the selected line rects)
 * - Manually via ObjectSelect tool (description empty or user-entered, region
 *   empty)
 *
 * Each slot can independently link to:
 * - A position in the document (page + coordinates)
 * - An external URL
 * - A markdown note
 *
 * Geometry contract:
 * - Empty region: `position` is the icon's top-left and `size` is 24x24, which
 *   is how every LinkObject saved before regions existed still behaves.
 * - Non-empty region: `position`/`size` are the region's bounding box, and the
 *   icon becomes a badge derived from `position` (see @ref iconRect).
