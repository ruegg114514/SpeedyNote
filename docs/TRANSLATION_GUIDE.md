# SpeedyNote Translation Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in translating SpeedyNote! This guide explains how to add or improve a translation starting from a fork of the source code.

SpeedyNote uses Qt's Linguist toolchain: strings in the C++ source are marked with `tr()`, extracted into `.ts` XML files, translated using Qt Linguist, and compiled into binary `.qm` files that the app loads at runtime.

> **Tip:** for a quick first pass you can run `scripts/translate_auto.py`, which fills in every entry using an LLM (default: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, free tier) with the English source and Chinese translation as references. See [Step 3½](#step-3½-optional--machine-translate-with-an-llm) below. Human review in Qt Linguist is still recommended afterwards.

## Language support status

| Language | Code | Status |
|---|---|---|
| English | `en` | Default — no translation file needed |
| Chinese Simplified | `zh` | Fully supported |
| Spanish | `es` | Partially translated — help welcome |
| French | `fr` | Partially translated — help welcome |

Any other language not listed above is not yet started.

---

## Prerequisites

You need the Qt Linguist tools installed on your machine. These are the same tools used to build SpeedyNote.

**Windows (MSYS2 clang64):**
```
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-tools
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```
sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev-tools
# or for Qt5 builds:
sudo apt install qttools5-dev-tools
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```
brew install qt
```

The tools you will use are:
- `lupdate` — scans the C++ source and updates `.ts` files with new/changed strings
- `linguist` — GUI editor for filling in translations
- `lrelease` — compiles a `.ts` file into the binary `.qm` format

---

## Step 1 — Fork and clone

Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SpeedyNote.git
cd SpeedyNote
```

---

## Step 2 — Create a new `.ts` file for your language

Translation source files live in `resources/translations/` and follow the naming pattern `app_<lang>.ts`, where `<lang>` is an [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) two-letter language code (e.g. `de` for German, `ja` for Japanese, `ko` for Korean).

If you are **starting a new language**, copy an existing file as a starting point and clear the translations:

```
cp resources/translations/app_zh.ts resources/translations/app_de.ts
```

Open the new file in a text editor and change the `language` attribute on the `<TS>` tag to match your locale (e.g. `de_DE`):

```xml
<TS version="2.1" language="de_DE">
```

Then clear every `<translation>` element (leave the tags but make the content empty) and change all `type="unfinished"` attributes to stay as `type="unfinished"`. You do not need to do this manually — the next step regenerates the file cleanly from the source.

If you are **improving an existing translation** (Spanish or French), skip this step and go directly to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 — Update the `.ts` file from source

Run the appropriate translation helper script from the repository root. These scripts call `lupdate` to scan the C++ source tree and insert any new or changed strings into every `.ts` file, then strip obsolete entries.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\translate.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS (bash):**
```bash
bash translate.sh
```

Both scripts auto-discover every `app_*.ts` file in `resources/translations/`, so your new file is picked up automatically.

After the script finishes, Qt Linguist opens with the default file (`app_zh.ts`). Close it — you will open your own file in the next step.

Alternatively, you can run `lupdate` directly:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lupdate source/ -ts resources/translations/app_de.ts

# Windows (MSYS2 clang64)
C:\msys64\clang64\bin\lupdate.exe source/ -ts resources/translations/app_de.ts
```

---

## Step 3½ (optional) — Machine-translate with an LLM

SpeedyNote ships a small Python helper, `scripts/translate_auto.py`, that fills in every `<translation>` in a `.ts` file by asking an LLM. It uses the English `<source>` as the primary input and the Chinese translation from `app_zh.ts` as a second reference, which significantly improves accuracy on short/ambiguous UI strings ("Open", "Save", "Insert", etc.).

This is handy when:

- You want to bootstrap a brand-new language quickly, then fine-tune only the entries that look wrong in Qt Linguist.
- You want to keep a partially-translated language in sync after a new release adds many strings at once.

### Install dependencies (once)

```
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

Works identically on Windows (PowerShell) and WSL / Linux / macOS.

### Get an API key

The default provider is **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, whose free tier is enough to translate the whole file several times over. Get a key at <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>.

Any OpenAI-compatible provider also works — see "Alternative providers" below.

### Run it

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "<your-key>"
python scripts/translate_auto.py --lang es
python scripts/translate_auto.py --lang fr
```

Linux / macOS / WSL:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="<your-key>"
python3 scripts/translate_auto.py --lang es
python3 scripts/translate_auto.py --lang fr
```

For a new language, first copy `app_zh.ts` to `app_<lang>.ts`, update the `<TS language="...">` attribute, clear the translations, run `translate.ps1` / `translate.sh` to sync it against the source, then run:

```
python scripts/translate_auto.py --lang de
```

### What the script does

- Walks every `<message>` in `resources/translations/app_<lang>.ts`.
- For each, sends the English source + the matching zh translation + the Qt context class name to the model.
- Writes the result back into the `<translation>` element and removes the `type="unfinished"` attribute so Qt Linguist treats it as finished.
- Handles plural forms (`<message numerus="yes">`) by translating each `<numerusform>` separately.
- Preserves `%1`, `%2`, `%n`, `&`-accelerators, HTML tags, and trailing ellipses.
- Deduplicates repeated strings so each unique one costs only one LLM call.

### Useful flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--lang es` / `--lang fr` / `--lang de` | Target language (ISO 639-1 code). Maps to `resources/translations/app_<lang>.ts`. |
| `--ts-file <path>` | Override the target path. |
| `--model gemini-2.5-flash` | LLM model (default). Try `gemini-2.5-pro` for higher quality. |
| `--no-overwrite` | Only fill empty entries; leave existing translations alone. |
| `--limit 20` | Translate only the first 20 unique strings — good for a cheap sanity check. |
| `--dry-run` | Print sample results instead of writing the file. |
| `--batch-size 25` | Number of strings per LLM request. |
| `--save-every 10` | Flush partial progress to disk every N batches (default 10). |

Typical sanity-check workflow:

```
python scripts/translate_auto.py --lang es --limit 20 --dry-run
```

### Alternative providers

The script targets any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (or pass `--base-url`) and point `--model` at whatever the provider uses.

| Provider | Env vars | Example model |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini *(default)* | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `--model gemini-2.5-flash` |
| DeepSeek | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | `--model deepseek-chat` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `--model gpt-4o-mini` |
| Groq | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `--model llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Local Ollama | `OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1` | `--model qwen2.5:14b` |

### After machine translation

Always open the file in Qt Linguist afterwards to spot-check — machine translation is a starting point, not a finish line. Pay special attention to:

- **Menu items** (look for missing `&` accelerators)
- **Button labels** (should be short)
- **Keyboard-shortcut strings** (e.g. "Ctrl+Shift+S" must stay unchanged)
- **Plural forms** (verify singular/plural each read naturally)

---

## Step 4 — Translate strings in Qt Linguist

Open your `.ts` file in Qt Linguist:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/linguist resources/translations/app_de.ts

# Windows (MSYS2 clang64)
C:\msys64\clang64\bin\linguist.exe resources/translations/app_de.ts
```

In Linguist:

- Strings marked **Unfinished** (yellow question mark) need a translation.
- Enter the translation in the bottom text field and press **Ctrl+Return** to mark it done.
- Strings with **no translation type** (green tick) are already accepted.
- Use **View → Sort by → Source text** to work through strings alphabetically.
- Save frequently with **Ctrl+S**.

Do not worry about translating every single string in one go. Partial translations are useful — untranslated strings fall back to English automatically.

---

## Step 5 — Compile the `.ts` file to a `.qm` binary

Once you are done translating, compile the `.ts` to a `.qm` binary:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lrelease resources/translations/app_de.ts \
    -qm resources/translations/app_de.qm

# Windows (MSYS2 clang64)
C:\msys64\clang64\bin\lrelease.exe resources/translations/app_de.ts `
    -qm resources/translations/app_de.qm
```

The `.qm` file is a compiled binary. Both the `.ts` source and the `.qm` binary should be committed to the repository — the `.ts` for future editing and the `.qm` so the file can be embedded in the app.

---

## Step 6 — Register the `.qm` file in `resources.qrc`

Open `resources.qrc` (in the repository root) and add an entry for your new language inside the `<qresource>` block, alongside the existing translation entries:

```xml
<file>resources/translations/app_de.qm</file>
```

The full block looks like this after the addition:

```xml
<file>resources/translations/app_zh.qm</file>
<file>resources/translations/app_es.qm</file>
<file>resources/translations/app_fr.qm</file>
<file>resources/translations/app_de.qm</file>   <!-- your new entry -->
```

This embeds the translation into the application binary so it works without any external files.

---

## Step 7 — Add the language to the in-app selector

Open `source/ControlPanelDialog.cpp` and find the `createLanguageTab()` function (around line 1742). Add your language to the `languageCombo` alongside the existing entries:

```cpp
languageCombo->addItem(tr("English"),                    "en");
languageCombo->addItem(tr("Español (Spanish)"),          "es");
languageCombo->addItem(tr("Français (French)"),          "fr");
languageCombo->addItem(tr("中文 (Chinese Simplified)"),  "zh");
languageCombo->addItem(tr("Deutsch (German)"),           "de"); // your new entry
```

Use the native name of the language in parentheses after the English name — this helps users identify their language even if the UI is in a language they cannot read.

---

## Step 8 — Verify the translation loads correctly

Build the project normally (see the relevant build guide in `docs/build_docs/`) and launch SpeedyNote. Go to **Settings → Language**, disable "Use System Language", select your language from the dropdown, and restart the app. All translated strings should appear in your language.

If a string still shows in English it means it either has no translation yet (acceptable) or the `.qm` file was not rebuilt after your last edit — re-run `lrelease` and rebuild.

---

## Step 9 — Submit a pull request

Commit all of the following files:

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `resources/translations/app_<lang>.ts` | Translation source (required for future editing) |
| `resources/translations/app_<lang>.qm` | Compiled binary (required for the app to embed) |
| `resources.qrc` | New `<file>` entry for the `.qm` |
| `source/ControlPanelDialog.cpp` | New entry in the language selector combo |

Open a pull request against the `main` branch. In the PR description, mention:

- Which language you are adding or improving
- Approximately what percentage of strings are translated
- Your preferred contact method if the maintainer has questions

## Tips

**Keeping your translation up to date**

When new strings are added to the source code in future versions, re-run the translation script (Step 3) to pull them into your `.ts` file. New strings will appear in Linguist with an "Unfinished" marker.

**Context information**

Some strings in Linguist show a "Comment" field — these are hints left by the developer to explain where or how a string is used. Use them to choose the right phrasing.

**Plurals**

Qt Linguist supports plural forms. If you see a string with `%n` in it, Linguist will ask for both singular and plural translations. Fill in both according to your language's grammar rules.

**Right-to-left languages**

Qt handles RTL layout mirroring automatically for languages like Arabic (`ar`) and Hebrew (`he`) when the locale is set correctly. No extra code changes are needed.

**Testing without a full build**

You can place the compiled `app_<lang>.qm` file next to the SpeedyNote binary and it will be loaded from there before the embedded QRC copy. This lets you iterate without rebuilding the whole application.
