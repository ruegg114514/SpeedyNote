- Official MSYS2 installer

- InnoSetup

---

### Environment

##### Qt Online Installer

Qt online installer is **no longer needed**.

##### MSYS2

Install with default settings.  

Install these packages:

```bash
# Build essentials
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-pkgconf

# Qt6
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-base mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-tools mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-declarative mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-translations mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-qt6-svg

# OCR (Windows Ink handwriting recognition, required for 64-bit builds)
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cppwinrt

# PDF (MuPDF and dependencies)
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-mupdf mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-harfbuzz mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-freetype mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-openjpeg2 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-gumbo-parser mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-mujs
```

> **Note:** PDF export requires MuPDF. If `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-mupdf` is not available, PDF export will be disabled on Windows. The app will still function normally for viewing and annotating PDFs.
> ``mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-pkgconf`` is only used for ``lupdate-qt6.exe`` to parse the new translations.
> **OCR:** The `cppwinrt` package provides C++/WinRT headers for the Windows Ink handwriting recognition engine. CMake automatically enables OCR (`SPEEDYNOTE_ENABLE_WINDOWS_INK_OCR`) on 64-bit Qt6 Windows builds. This uses the built-in Windows Ink API (available on Windows 10 1703+) and requires no external model downloads.

**For ARM64 systems:** Replace `x86_64` with `aarch64` in the commands above, and use `clangarm64` instead of `clang64` in the paths below. 

##### Path

Add this directory to Path. If you have an arm64 system, replace the paths from clang64 to clangarm64. 

```cmd
C:\msys64\clang64\bin
```

and then restart your PC.

##### CMake Setup

In the CMake Tools extension of Visual Studio Code, find the `Cmake: Cmake Path` option and change it to `C:\msys64\clang64\bin\cmake.exe` .
Add this directory to Path. As always, if you have an arm64 system, replace the paths from clang64 to clangarm64. 

---

### Build

Run `compile.ps1`to build SpeedyNote. The complete build is in `build`.You may want to delete some temporary files that CMake generated. For arm64 builds, you need to run `compile.ps1 -arm64` instead.

### Packaging

Use`InnoSetup`to pack SpeedyNote. Hit the play button and InnoSetup automatically finish the packaging process.
